Mini Thermal Receipt Printer	http://www.adafruit.com/products/597	1	$49.95	This is the part that prints out the compliment!
Thermal Paper Roll	http://www.adafruit.com/products/599	2	$1.95	You want at least 2 rolls for testing, but you might want more than that for funsies.
5V 4A Switching Power Supply	http://www.adafruit.com/products/1466	1	$14.95	The power supply needs to be 5V, and it needs to provide at least 3 amps of power. Switching is better. Don't be tempted to use one you have lying around unless you know what you're doing.
Raspberry Pi Model B+	http://www.adafruit.com/products/1914	1	$39.95	This is an actual computer that runs Linux. It runs the show: controls the thermal printer, runs the compliment routine, detects the button press, and activates the lighting routine. You can use the $25 Model A+ if you can find one, and are comfortable not having an ethernet connection over to your Pi to set it up.
4GB MicroSD Card	http://www.adafruit.com/products/102	1	$7.95	You need one of these to be the hard drive for the Raspberry Pi. It doesn't have to be special - if you've got one lying around from an old phone or something it'll work. You do want at least 4GB though.
RPi Breakout Cable Cobbler	http://www.adafruit.com/products/2029	1	$6.95	This makes wiring up the Rasbperry Pi about a zillion times nicer. Highly recommended, but not strictly necessary.
Arduino Uno R3	http://www.adafruit.com/products/50	1	$24.95	This currently controls the LED lighting. You could definitely get away with a smaller Arduino such as the smaller $10 Adafruit Trinket Pro if all you want to do is run LEDs. But if you wanted to eventually extend to sounds, motor movements etc., just get the R3 to start with.
Gigantic Arcade Button w/ LED	http://www.adafruit.com/products/1185	1	$9.95	This is the button I used for the top of our compliment bot. You could get away with any switch you've got lying about (Adafruit has a big selection), but I think the large button lends an air of... awesome.
LED Lights (Pack of 25)	http://www.adafruit.com/products/845	1	$9.95	I only use 10 currently in compliment bot, and I used rainbow colors since we had the LEDs lying around. You can pretty much use any size or color of bare LED, they come in a staggering array of sizes + shapes. Go crazy. This link is a good place to start. If you're comfortable with programming Arduino / wiring, you may consider using a NeoPixel strip/ring instead of bare LEDs + a shift register. It might just be cheaper + easier in the long run.
Pig Tail Cables (Pack of 4)	http://www.adafruit.com/products/1003	2	$3.90	These are basically cable extenders for the LED lights. They vastly simplify the wiring up, and replacing of any broken LEDs.
74HC595 Shift Register (Pack of 3)	http://www.adafruit.com/products/450	1	$2.75	A shift register allows you to control many LEDs from one Arduino pin. Handy dandy. You'll only need one from this pack of 3.
DC Barrel Jack	http://www.adafruit.com/products/610	1	$2.95	This is where the power comes in. Gotta have that.
Perma-Proto Board	http://www.adafruit.com/products/1609	1	$4.50	This is where you solder all of the things. You might want to get a couple if you're not good at soldering...
330Ω Resistor (Pack of 25)	https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11507	1	$0.95	These are current limiters for the LED lights. Without them, you will probably burn out the LEDs. Because of Ohms Law bro. I wish Adafruit sold these, but they don't. Sorry about that. You could pick them up from RadioShack also. The ohmage isn't super-critical, you could get 220Ω or as high as 1KΩ. It'll affect the brightness of the LED, but not much else.
16-Pin DIP Socket	https://www.sparkfun.com/products/7938	1	$0.50	You solder this to the proto board, and the shift register sits in it. That way, you don't have to solder the shift register directly to the board, and risk burning it out. Maybe get 3, so you have one for each of your shift registers. Adafruit doesn't have these either, but RadioShack / Sparkfun do.
Robot Shell		1		You need some place to put the electronics :) We used cardboard for ours. Getting fancier is encouraged. Sharing pictures is encouraged.
		TOTAL:	$180.65	Note: I'm assuming you already have a soldering iron, solder + hookup wire. If you don't have that, you should get that too.
